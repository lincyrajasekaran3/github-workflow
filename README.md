# GitHub Workflow Practice

This repository is part of my learning sprint at Kalvium.  
The goal is to practice using Git and GitHub properly by:

- Making clean and clear commits
- Pushing directly to the main branch
- Keeping a neat and readable commit history

✅ No branches  
✅ No pull requests  
✅ Just clean version control
