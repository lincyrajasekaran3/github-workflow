# GitHub Workflow Practice

This repository is part of my learning sprint at Kalvium.  
The goal is to practice using Git and GitHub properly by:

- Making clean and clear commits
- Pushing directly to the main branch
- Keeping a neat and readable commit history

✅ No branches  
✅ No pull requests  
✅ Just clean version control

---

## 📘 What I Learned

- How to create a GitHub repository and clone it locally
- The importance of writing meaningful commit messages
- How to push changes directly to the `main` branch
- Why version control helps keep code organized and easy to understand

---

## 🛠️ Usage

To try this workflow:

1. Clone this repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/lincyrajasekaran3/github-workflow.git`

2. Make changes to the code or README file

3. Commit with a clear message:  
   `git commit -m "Explain what changed and why"`

4. Push your changes:  
   `git push origin main`
